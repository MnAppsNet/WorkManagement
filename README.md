# WorkManagement
This is a simple tool used for work/task management. It is used along with an Outlook instalation and it is able to retrieve tasks automaticaly from the mail.

To retrieve tasks from Outlook :
1. You set a mail category on outlook that you will use to mark the mails related to a task.
2. You set the task mail category on the settings of WorkManagement
3. That's it, when you receive a mail with the category configured it will be automatically to your tasks

If no outlook instalation is found this functionality will be unavailable
